            <p class="first">Two of the most important terms in the Software Development industry are ‘Open Source’ and ‘Proprietary’ which both refer to juxtaposing ideologies of how software should be developed and managed. Open Source Software (OSS for short) refers to software that has publicly available Source Code that is free to be modified and redistributed by anyone (Open Source Initiative, 2006) whereas Proprietary Software solely belongs to a private company / individual and the Source Code is not accessible to the public and cannot be modified (EPAM, 2023). Licenses are the key differentiating factor between the two types of development model, they’re a text document within the software which details what a user is legally entitled to do with the programme. A Proprietary license is like renting a movie as you pay to have access to use the software but do not own it or the code it’s built from. However, Open Source licenses are like owning a Lego set, you have full ownership over the code and can assemble or modify it in any way you want. Proprietary software is still the dominant ideology and while OSS initially only appealed to hobbyist’s, Big Tech has since started to embrace it as well but to understand why the developers distanced themselves from proprietary software and founded the Open Source movement in the first place a brief history of the model is needed. </p>
            <p>The movement began in the 1970s when an MIT printer kept jamming, Richard Stallman wanted to fix the problem but was refused access to the printer’s source code so quit the company and founded GNU (an Open Source Operating System) and the Free Software movement (CNBC, 2019). Even as recently as the 1990s it would’ve been seen as “preposterous” for OSS to threaten the traditional industry (Fitzgerald B, 2006) with Microsoft very publicly stating that OSS was “un-American” (CNBC, 2019) in a blatant attempt to put consumers off the practice. Linux, an Open Source alternative to Windows, launched in 1991 and was quickly adopted by companies thanks to its versatility and by the year 2000 NASA, Dell and IBM were all using it. Linux’s success led to the term ‘Open-Source’ being coined in 1998 over ‘Free-software’ to appear more business friendly and the era of ‘OSS 2.0’ began which was more formal, controlled and financially incentivised (Fitzgerald B, 2006). Google threw their hat into the ring in September 2008 with the launch of their browser Chrome built on top of an Open Source browser known as Chromium; stating that they made it Open Source so that “where we’ve developed innovative new technology, we hope that other projects can use it to make their projects better” (Google, 2008). Chrome is, to this day, the most popular browser with 65% of the market share (GlobalStats, 2024) beating its proprietary alternatives by a landslide. Today, Microsoft is considered “a leader in OSS” (CNBC, 2019) and there has been a strong sentiment among many developers that the “Open Source movement has altered the basic nature of software development” (Fitzgerald B, 2006).  We now live in a world where 96.3% of the top 1 million web servers, 90% of cloud infrastructure and all the worlds super computers run on Linux with a further 72% of phones running on Android (Elad B, 2024). With all this vastly important infrastructure and technology being accessible to anyone, including people who could want to exploit vulnerabilities in these systems, it is clear why questions over the security of the practice have been raised. There have also been questions asked about whether or not the development model is viable for businesses to use and profit from as well as whether Open Source projects feature reliable enough code to build from and use on a day to day basis. As with any change to a long-established norm, there has been stern debate over the benefits and drawbacks of OSS when compared to proprietary alternatives with misinformation and misconceptions flooding arguments on both sides of the discussion.</p>
            <p>Hence, I chose to explore this topic thoroughly as I believe it could be a fascinating way forward for the software development industry as it would provide a much more open and transparent relationship between developer and consumer that is desperately needed in the modern age where society is becoming much more conscious of the ways in which the major Big Tech companies are constantly tracking us and collecting our personal data for their own benefit. As I have researched using a large range of different sources and now have a good understanding of the topic, I believe I am in a strong position to come to a firm overall conclusion on whether the benefits of an Open Source development ultimately outweigh its drawbacks through a report that can be understood by anyone even without prior knowledge.</p>
            <div class="decorativeBar"></div>
            <p>The biggest conceived threat for OSS is its security which isn’t surprising as it would initially seem that publicising code is like leaving the house with the doors wide open, you’re simply asking for trouble. There is however considerable evidence to suggest that OSS can have some of the most robust and security conscious code on the market. A 2007 study by Lorraine Morgan and Patrick Finnegan involved 45 minute semi-structured interviews with employees from across 13 companies who used OSS. Their findings concluded that a majority of companies believed that OSS had “high security” with the common consensus being that there were 2 main reasons for this. The first being that, due to the availability of source code, it seemed that for every person who would scour the project looking for vulnerabilities to exploit there was another person who would do the same but would report the poor practice to the project’s maintainers, or better yet, fix the problem and contribute it to the project themselves. This idea led to ‘Linus Law’ being adopted for the industry in the form of “Given enough eyeballs, every bug is shallow” (Fitzgerald B, 2006). This is supported by the fact that security issues are typically fixed by the community much quicker than the slow update schedules of proprietary software companies which is still dependant on whether the next update even includes a fix, as it’s a lot harder to discover vulnerabilities and they’re often left in proprietary software until it’s too late (AlMarzouq et al, 2005). The second main contributing factor is that there is a much greater awareness of security during the initial design phases of an Open Source project. This leads to well-planned and documented code that has security built into the heart of it making it hard for hackers to find exploits as every line has been designed and crafted to be as efficient as possible opposed to proprietary code that is known to be sloppy as it can be ‘hidden under the rug’ so to speak as no one will see the code. Development stages for OSS formalised quickly and became much more in-depth from the days where it could be described as just a developer perceiving an “itch worth scratching” (Raymond E, 2001). Most code submitted to a project will have to pass tests that check for common vulnerabilities and a peer review to ensure vulnerabilities are kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p>These arguments show some clear benefits for security in OSS. The evolutionary philosophy of seeking out and fixing vulnerabilities quickly is undoubtedly more effective than the often more reactionary style of Closed-Source where problems are likely to only be fixed after being exposed by an attack. A robust planning stage seems to also be beneficial at ironing out problems before they even arise as there is nowhere to hide poor and exploitable code. These reasons give developers and users piece of mind that they can remain safe whilst using OSS. Two of the companies surveyed by Morgan and Finnegan felt that “OSS would not be beneficial in terms of security” which leads into an exploration of the drawbacks OSS has in terms of security.</p>
            <p>No matter how much work goes into preventing vulnerabilities it is unfortunately inevitable that exploits will make it into production level code. Sonatype is a company who are dedicated to maintaining a secure Open Source software supply chain and so every year, they publish an in-depth review into the ‘State of the Software Supply Chain’ akin to the U.S Presidents yearly State of the Union addresses. The most recent report from October 2023 casts doubt onto whether or not OSS is truly secure with some shocking statistics about the security of many Open Source Projects. Before exploring this report, it is necessary to define what a ‘Malicious Packet’ is. They’re chunks of data or code intentionally designed to exploit weaknesses in computer systems.  Sonatype’s key finding was that the number of malicious packets in OSS had doubled from 2022 to 2023 reaching an estimated 245,032, meaning that 1 in 8 Open Source downloads posed a risk, equating to 3.97 billion monthly downloads from the Sonatype managed OSS hosting platform Maven Central. Even with 39% of companies claiming they discover vulnerabilities within 7 days, there is a worrying disconnect in the perception of vulnerabilities as 67% of companies believed their software was completely vulnerability free with only 10% stating they had been affected by an attack within the past 12 months. Interestingly though, it was found that 96% of projects that featured malicious packets actually had newer versions available that had the vulnerability removed which suggests that “Correctable user behaviour continues to be the leading cause of software supply chain attacks” (Sonatype, 2023). Sonatype’s research has also uncovered a worrying trend, higher level hacker groups are targeting Open Source more and more with state-backed hacker groups such as North Korea’s ‘Lazarus’ inserting multiple malicious packets into projects making it more important than ever that extra precautionary measures are taken to ensure OSS cannot be used as a tool for politically motivated attacks.</p>
            <p>The Sonatype report features damming evidence that illustrates OSS still has its fair share of security vulnerabilities even with the many precautions put in place to prevent them. 3.97 billion infected monthly downloads from one Open Source vendor alone is staggering and emphasises the risk that businesses building important technological infrastructure face if they choose to use OSS as a base. The fact that the number of malicious packets within projects had doubled in the space of one year highlights that there could be a growing risk within the modern Open Source community especially mixed with the rise of technological espionage from countries such as Russia, China and North Korea.</p>
            <p>Overall, Open Source Security has always been and will remain a contentious topic for developers to debate with clear benefits when going with Open Source and Proprietary software. I think it’s reasonable to argue that the security benefits of an Open Source model do ultimately outweigh the drawbacks as whilst there are many damming statistics that paint a negative picture of OSS security within the Sonatype report ultimately the fact that 96% of vulnerable downloads have a newer version available is the most important as it complements the idea that Open Source software is evolutionary and that whilst vulnerabilities may slip into production level code form now and again it is quickly removed before it can be exploited. Early planning stages are instrumental in setting out how the project will grow and expand in the future and so security being a more conscious part of the process is undoubtedly beneficial to preventing problems from cropping up later down the line but as 1 in 8 downloads have a vulnerability it suggests that early planning is not as instrumental in keeping vulnerabilities from entering the project as it originally seemed likely due to the fact that people contributing later on are not involved with the planning process so will not understand some of the key precautionary measures taken.</p>
            <div class="decorativeBar"></div>
            <p>Reliability has long been considered one of the strongest benefits for developing software with an Open Source model even though the community is made up solely of volunteers. The main reason most developers contribute to Open Source projects is because they use the software themselves every day and want to help improve it for everybody else that does as well. If they spot a bug that they know they can fix or if they think of a feature that would improve the software, they will more often than not get the go ahead to implement it. This has led to the idea that there is a “virtually unlimited number of developers” (AlMarzouq et al, 2005) within the community each with their own different skill sets that ensures no problem is impossible to tackle as there will always be a developer out there with the knowledge necessary to tackle it. When considering that these developers aren’t “constrained as is the case with proprietary software” (AlMarzouq et al, 2005) to limiting themselves and simply working on just one project at a time the sense of fatigue and burnout that developers go through isn’t really present within this community. The freedom of choice to work on whatever you want, when you want and the fact that you’re not constantly working against a looming deadline when volunteering in your spare time leads to Open Source developers writing well optimised and documented code which gives their applications “high dependability” (Morgan et al, 2007).  Another commonly discussed benefit of choosing an Open Source development model is the “high availability of applications” (Morgan et al, 2007) on the market with some likely already being similar to what you’re developing. This benefits individuals and businesses greatly, as they can take parts of these projects to use within their own code in order to speed up development drastically, a practice which would be impossible in the proprietary industry. The copying of code is not only encouraged, but widely celebrated as it is one of the core pillars of OSS. It’s believed that by using code already written, time isn’t wasted working on a solution that has already been discovered but instead your time can be used on strengthening the knowledge of the OSS community by finding new solutions. Aaron Swartz, who played an instrumental role in creating the Creative Commons licenses, believed that “information wants to be free” (CNN, 2013) as it was only the pooling of information that could advance our understanding and push the technology industry forward.</p>
            <p>These arguments paint a clear picture that Open Source code has been held to a very high standard being considered optimised, efficient and well documented as the developers are also active users which ultimately encourages them to produce the best work they can as it becomes a passion project opposed to just another job. Also, the ability to reuse pre-existing code from a wide range of OSS not only improves reliability as if the code has already been used in a project it will likely be fully functioning, but it can also relieve some of the stresses a programmer would face if they had to create all the code themselves leaving them in a clearer state of mind to produce better code.</p>
            <p>However, in the modern software development landscape a magnitude of problems have arisen diluting project commits from true Open Source Developers. One of the most worrying trends to emerge recently is code being committed to projects that is completely AI generated with no real purpose (t3.gg, 2024). It does not fix bugs or implement new features and is suspected to simply be used for the purposes of spamming the maintainers of a project in order to delay development. This phenomenon opened up wider discussion on whether or not it is acceptable to use AI to help developers write code at all withing OSS considering the ambiguous ways in which the data that trains these Language Models is collected. As we currently understand it, popular Large Language Models on the market (ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude) are all trained from Open Source projects on hosting platforms such as GitHub and Maven Central, but the key issue is that they completely disregard the licenses that these projects come with. Many OSS licenses stipulate that if even snippets of their code are used within a separate project they should be credited in some shape or form and many go further and directly dictate what licenses can be used for projects derived from their code so if an AI regurgitates code it has seen from a different project the owner of the software could be breaching copyright law (Argentieri S, 2023) and would face the same consequences as if they maliciously copied it themselves. With the prospect of AI writing indistinguishable code from human developers in the near future it is clear why extra checks must now be put in place in order to ensure that software does not violate the licenses of others by accidentally accepting AI code into the project.</p>
            <p>The door into the proprietary software industry continues to become harder and harder for beginner programmers and software engineers to get a foot into which leads them down many paths in order for their résumés to stick out to recruitment teams and one of these is contributing to OSS. Whilst this may initially seem like it would benefit the wider open source community and increase the reliability of many projects with an even larger pool of developers to lend their expertise it has actually led to the opposite effect. Instead of an enthusiastic hobbyist workforce dedicated to fixing issues a growing section of the community is now doing the bare minimum in order to be perceived as an active programmer which leads to a poorer quality of code disrupting the ‘ecosystem of people’ working in the OSS community (t3.gg, 2024). This subsequently hassles the already overworked maintainers of projects as they get bombarded with functional but poorly optimised code to fix small bugs that will still require a full round of testing before implementation as if it was a major important fix. This problem is amplified by the yearly ‘Hacktoberfest’ which seemingly has the positive mission statement of encouraging people to contribute to OSS by offering free t-shirts if they reach a certain number of commits to projects. Unfortunately, even with the best of intentions this leads to yearly commits to projects as useless as swapping all speech marks in code to quotation marks or fixing minute grammar mistakes in order to qualify and claim the shirt. The developer Domenic Denicola denounced Hacktoberfest in a scathing blog post stating that “Hacktoberfest is a corporate-sponsored Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attack against the open source maintainer community” (Denicola D, 2020) with a DDOS attack being a cyber attack that sends so many requests to a server it cannot cope and shuts down. He went on to illustrate the scale of the disruption by claiming that “The rate of spam pull requests is, at this time, around four per hour and it’s not even October yet in my time zone” (Denicola D, 2020). Many other OSS maintainers quickly followed suit and blocked their projects from qualifying for Hacktoberfest in protest of the event exponentially increasing the already heavy workload on maintainers volunteering their spare time to lead these projects as they felt the poor code would tarnish the reliability of the projects that they’re passionate about keeping functioning.</p>
            <p>The blog post from Domenic shows the first hand rage from an Open Source Maintainer to the fact that the reputable reliability of OSS is no longer a guarantee when using the model. Threats of legal trouble from the use of AI and poor optimisation from half-hearted human developers clearly shows the job is getting harder and harder for maintainers with new problems causing them logistical headaches frequently. If problems continue to spiral it could lead to more and more maintainers quitting and if replacements cannot be found OSS will drastically suffer from the lack of leadership and direction which could lead to them being abandoned.</p>
            <p>Even with reliability being challenged by new innovations in the field, there is still considerable evidence to suggest that overall, the benefits still outweigh the drawbacks when evaluating the reliability of the model. A reputation for reliability simply doesn’t come from nowhere which meaning that it must have been worked for and built from hundreds of projects spanning the past couple of decades that had passionate developers working hard to earn that prestigious title for the whole community. This hard work cannot simply be discredited due to trends that have arisen in the past couple of years that like any trend within the industry could become yesterday’s news any day. Similarly, the abundant supply of reliable software currently available that predates these concerns is not going anywhere and is still publicly accessible for anyone to view and download meaning developers can still take the code without concern for the possibilities of legal trouble. Even with projects still actively updated, the industry will adapt like it always has done to face these new challenges and will likely find innovative new solutions to these problems that no one has even thought of yet. Fears that the pool of developers within the community will dry up with talent being lost to the new wave of people simply using the community to their advantage also seem overblown when considering that the old guard is still around working on projects and there is still new talent actually eager to take part and get to work helping develop some of the software they love to use, and the number of these people still massively outweighs the number of opportunists so new quality code is all but guaranteed to be developed in the future.</p>
            <div class="decorativeBar"></div>
            <p>Considering OSS is publicly accessible and available for free it should come as no surprise that some businesses have adopted the model as a cost cutting technique; it may be surprising to learn however that it isn’t just small start-ups taking advantage of this but big tech companies too. Out of all the companies surveyed by Morgan and Finnegan half of the respondents cited lower costs to their business as a benefit (Morgan et al, 2007). Savings can be seen from many different areas when using or developing OSS. If the software a business uses to aid development is Open Source, they will benefit from easier access and free or heavily reduced license fees when compared to their proprietary counterparts. They will also benefit from continuous support with regular free updates, that would likely be paid under a proprietary model. When a business is developing their OSS, they can reduce their costs by incorporating OSS components directly into their project negating the need to spend money when the work has already been completed by someone else. Once a business has built up an audience for its software they could begin outsourcing tasks, such as creating new features and bug fixes, to the wider Open Source Community (AlMarzouq et al, 2005) taking some of the workload off employed developers who can channel their efforts into other areas of a project that may require work. Tech Giants such as Google and Microsoft are also progressively using Open Source more and more for the development of their flagship products. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are both built on top of an Open Source browser maintained by Google known as ‘Chromium’ which sees over 100 commits from the community per day. Whilst they will be seeking some of the cost savings, they both also cite collaboration (Google, 2008) with the community as a key reason for participating which could suggest they’re using this practice to grow a closer connection with the users of their products.</p>
            <p>Reducing costs is clearly a strong argument for companies to start using an Open Source Development Model as it frees up funding that can be hard to find in new start-ups for use in different parts of the development process. Interestingly, it also seems that Tech Giants whose business practices are often negatively perceived and considered to be shady in part due to their secrecy are attempting to use Open Source to be more open and seem more down to earth and approachable.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, initial savings through using OSS can be greatly offset post development as nearly every company in this sector struggles with finding a way to monetise their end products. Due to the uniqueness of the Open Source model and the many caveats that come with it no project is able to use the same monetisation model (Hughes K, 2023) which leads to difficulties if the company is unable to assess what works for them fast enough in order to stay afloat in an overcrowded competitive industry. Some of the typical ways for OSS to generate income are through selling support services, selling additional features and openly accepting donations but as Emily Omier who is an expert in Open Source commercial strategy says it is imperative to not be seen as wanting to “wring dollars out of the Open Source community” (Hughes K, 2023). However, it is often hard to strike this delicate balance correctly and leads to the vast majority of Open Source companies failing to sustain themselves. ‘Diaspora’ was an Open Source decentralised alternative to social media sites such as Facebook that saw initial success with half a million users upon launch but came to a tragic end when the company failed to find a viable monetisation model leading to one of the co-developers, Ilya Zhitomirskiy, taking his own life just one year after launch (Hughes K, 2023). Businesses exist for the sole purpose of generating profits and so countless OSS start-ups end under similar circumstances when the model simply becomes unviable for them to continue development. Unfortunately, the struggles associated with monetisation lead to companies making the decision to ditch Open Source licenses by “pulling the rug when software sales slump” (Geerling J, 2024) and switching to more profitable ‘Source Available’ licenses which only grant access to source code after a fee is paid. HashiCorp is software that provides infrastructure management tools and was originally fully Open Source but after a difficult period of underperformance they jumped ship on their licenses, switched to a proprietary model and ended up selling the company for $6 Billion (USD). RedHat, another formerly fully Open Source business, was a part of one of the largest tech acquisitions and mergers in history when IBM bought them out for a staggering $34 Billion (USD) but again this came after curtailing the extent of their openness (Geerling J, 2024).</p>
            <p>These arguments are undoubtedly worrying for any business attempting to break into the Open Source industry as they are stacked up against nearly insurmountable odds for something as simple as their survival and with many notable examples of business thriving once moving away from the model it should lead developers to ensure they have a fool proof plan and are truly dedicated to an Open Source model if they still wish to go forward and use Open Source.</p>
            <p>Even with there being examples of businesses who have seen great success by operating under a solely Open Source model It is clear that from the perspective of the vast majority of business’ an Open Source Development Model is ultimately detrimental to their success and survival as the RedHat and HashiCorp acquisitions clearly show they’re more valuable when they’re proprietary. Similar to this, the fact that Google and Microsoft can only afford to explore Open Source ventures as they have plenty of other proprietary projects that make more than enough money for them to lose some in these departments   clearly demonstrates that the model fails to be self-sufficient. Whilst the short term savings such as the incorporation of existing code to save on money will certainly seem appealing to anyone working in a start-up it is clear that there isn’t a feasible outcome where they’re guaranteed success and a significant return on their investment which inevitably makes the initial savings worthless as there is no company left to use the money. Some may argue that the inability of companies to succeed using an Open Source model may not necessarily be to the detriment of the model itself but just down to the simple fact that it was never meant to support a profitable business. The model was created to help independent and smaller groups of developers produce software with the aim of advancing the industry and not with the aim of making money and so cannot be blamed for failing at something it was not intended to do. However, the fact that there are successful for profit Open Source companies and a market created by demand from the community suggests that businesses should be able to make it work in the right circumstances, but it is just unfortunate facts that the model does not give these companies greater support.</p>
            <div class="decorativeBar"></div>
            <p>Ultimately, considering the Computer Science industry is currently one of the most fluid and constantly evolving industries in the world with different fads and techniques going from having a strangle hold over every developer the one day, to outdated and obsolete the next it therefore makes sense that developers must choose a software development model that enables them to keep up and adapt quickly with these trends. The evolutionary nature of Open Source development simply allows for fluidity better than any closed source proprietary model ever could with its shared knowledge approach that pushes innovation forward just like the industry itself aims to do. As Open Source has already drastically evolved since it first emerged from a simple dispute over a printer in an MIT tech lab in the 1970s and managed to steady the ship and survive those challenges, I am sure it will work through the new wave of issues such as AI generated code and lack of support for businesses. The common consensus that Open Source is less secure is a harsh over exaggeration as the model’s evolutionary update philosophy and security cautious approach demonstrate that the model can produce exceptionally secure code, so the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for this sub-topic. Even with 1 in 8 OSS downloads from Maven Central containing a security vulnerability it would seem as though the practice is full of security concerns 96% of these downloads had newer versions available with the problems resolved meaning that user behaviour could be blamed rather than the development model used. Reliability is the closest debate within this report as it was traditionally one of the strongest areas for Open Source code and the reason many people chose the model but recent dynamic changes in the industry left this in doubt but overall, the benefits do just surpass the drawbacks. AI code generation poses a serious threat to Open Source reliability not only because of code being faulty and unfunctional but due to the legal issues that can arise from AI’s regurgitating code it has seen from elsewhere. However, this is overshadowed by the large community of developers dedicated to helping each other resolve issues. Whilst the Open Source model thrives in the previous sub-topics, it clearly falls short in providing enough financial support in order to ensure businesses are commercially successful and so the drawbacks in this section outweigh the benefits. Businesses will see savings during the initial phases of the company by incorporating existing Open Source code to save on development costs, however, these savings are quickly made redundant by the fact that nearly every Open Source company fails to find a monetisation model and is forced into bankruptcy or pivots and becomes a non-profit. I believe I achieved and exceeded all of my goals with this project as I tried my hardest to give definitions for key terms where it was necessary and ensured that each point I mad was backed up with sources that I evaluated effectively to ensure were not overly bias to any side of the debate. I also believe my Sub-Topics covered a wide range of views that enabled me to understand this topic a lot better and come to a firmer overall conclusion that an Open Source Development Model is ultimately much more beneficial.</p>
