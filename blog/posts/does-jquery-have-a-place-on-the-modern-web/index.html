            <p class="first">jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library which was initially released on August 26th 2006 with the aim of simplifying code whilst doing more with those fewer lines. It quickly skyrocketed in popularity to become one of the most used JavaScript libraries in the world. However, its continued use seems unlikely as it becomes more of a relic of the wild west era of the internet; a time where there was no standardisation between browsers and programming languages were less advanced.</p>
            <div class="decorativeBar"></div>
            <p>	One of jQuery’s main selling points initially was the unity it brought across browsers. The developers and maintainers of browsers in the late 2000s had no communication between each other leading to inconsistent API implementation. Web Developers of the time could only work around this by using long, performance draining code to ensure their websites worked across most browsers on most platforms consistently. jQuery provided a consistent and relatively simple way to achieve this which enabled development time to be used on more pressing issues rather than fueling time into simply getting the website to work. The widespread success from jQuery's API implementation eventually reached the Browser Development teams themselves and so work began on optimising API implementations.</p>
            <p>The era of no communication between browsers was over and rushed in a new revolutionary age for web developers. Google released their Chromium Web Browser (the free and Open Source base Chrome is built off of) in 2008 which led to more and more browsers having the same underlying engine so their API implementation was the same. Most other mainstream alternatives to Chrome are built off of Chromium such as Opera, Brave and even now Microsoft Edge. Apple and Mozzila even collaborated with Google via the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group to ensure their independent browsers did not fall behind. Another key breakthrough is the speed in which browser updates were implemented, they were now being updated independently of the Operating System so they could keep on top of new features in programming languages quicker and evolve faster. All this work made jQuery's unitary features essentially pointless as the same effect could be reached with native JavaScript now. Hence jQuery went from essentially being a necessity for developers to include if they wanted a working website, to being something that developers chose for other (less substantial) features like animations and simple code. All this browser evolution unfortunately was being undermined as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer continued to cause endless problems. It seemed as though an infinite amount of bugs were Internet Explorer specific and had no documented fix as the underlying IE engine was a mess of unreadable spaghetti code. Internet Explorer dominated the browser market share of the late 90s and 00s as it came pre-installed on Windows computers so for many developers the only way to deal with these problems was to implement jQuery. Even until the very end Internet Explorer was a problem that gave developers no end of nightmares if they even attempted to work with it. Thankfully Microsoft rather hastily dropped support for the final versions after it became apparent that it was holding back the Web Development industry. Their next browser (the original) Microsoft Edge took much more care in making the developer and user experiences more friendly.</p>
            <p>As the years continued on even the other main uses for jQuery began to be beaten by native solutions. CSS animations were updated greatly from what they had been before and it now became simpler and more performance efficient to write them using CSS instead. Arguably however, the final nail in the coffin was the fact that developers moved onto using powerful frameworks instead of simple libraries. React, Vue and Angular are some of the most popular frameworks and they handle not only the updating of content on a page but also the initial rendering of the content which grants much more control and freedom to the developer. Frameworks like these can slash development time meaning that updates and new apps can be created at a speed that jQuery simply does not allow for. These frameworks were also Open Source like jQuery so they evolved just as quickly and offer an experience that simply can no longer be rivalled.</p>
            <div class="decorativeBar"></div>
            <p>However, as of February 6th 2024, jQuery 4.0.0 entered beta and shows steps in the right direction. It has dropped support for legacy versions of Internet Explorer, removed outdated APIs that now have native solutions and implemented many other optimizations that could propel it back into the mainstream but more than likely this is too little too late. Welcome changes I’m sure for those who still use jQuery in their projects regularly but it is still not enough to be a serious competitor in the modern market.</p>
            <p>As it stands today, jQuery was a revolutionary tool that moulded the modern web landscape we have today and its legacy will certainly live on with many of its APIs and features now being natively present within browsers. It does still receive updates to this day but with notable websites that previously used it, such as Github and the British Government, dropping it in favour of more modern solutions it is now clear that what both a developer and consumer wants from a website has moved on from far outside of jQuery's scope. The ‘ahead of its time’ moniker was true upon initial release but clearly does not hold up today 18 years on. There is nothing wrong with still using jQuery as thousands upon thousands of websites still do but it just is no longer the most efficient and feature rich option. So jQuery may still have a place for many but the web has definitely moved on and it's sad to see such an influential library lose a place it once firmly held as it diminishes into something only used by a few loyal developers.</p>
